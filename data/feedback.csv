"It does a good job of explaining the 14 main parts (called thematic areas) of Ghana’s plan in things like internet access, teacher training, and helping all students learn, even those with disabilities."
"The chatbot’s tone is too formal and repetitive, often using the phrase “ the Ghana EdTech Strategy or under the Ghana EdTech Strategy”, which makes the interaction feel rigid."
