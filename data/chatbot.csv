I would like to recommend that a security features must added to the chatbot which will restrict learners on the platform to use it for the purpose of the which he/she is meant to use chartbot for. Thank you.

"The chartbot is a great experience but I think needs more improvement in the safety side of use.

It's User-friendly
The use of a chatbot to interact with the strategy document is interesting. It seems to be able to give sufficient information about the strategy. I expected it to be able to point me to the location of the full strategy.
"As a tool for future use, I imagine it's good for quick questions and referencing. However, for implementers, reviewing the actual document to the letter, will be relevant in making sure that the right thing is being done."
EdTech Strategy Bot provides quick and immediate answers that satisfies my curiosity.
Good
Works fine
"So far, my initial queries using the EdTech Chatbot have been answered in substantial detail, which is extremely helpful for my analysis. I also appreciate the related question suggestions provided by the chatbot, which is proving very effective at deepening the scope of the conversation."
"So far, my initial queries using the EdTech Chatbot have been answered in substantial detail, which is extremely helpful for my analysis. I am currently formulating further questions across several sectors (including sustainability, AI governance, and inclusion) to ensure my final channeled feedback is as comprehensive and actionable as possible."

I am highly satisfied with the feedback so far
Great
Stays on the topic. Accurate
"Tone: It's too formal and dense for a greeting. A user just saying hello expects something warmer or lighter before diving into content.
e.g., It could start with: Hi there! Great to have you here. 
I'm Edtech, your guide to Ghana's EdTech Strategy"
Very direct and straight to the point. It doesn't beat about the bush regarding information about the Edtech strategy
Needs more functionality

"Interacting with the Bot was helpful. I liked how it explained that EdTech isn't just online stuff but also what happens in the classroom. The examples were ok too. But honestly, it felt a bit too formal , it would be nicer if it used simpler words or gave real examples from schools so it’s easier to relate to."
"The repetition of under the Ghana Edtech Strategy seem a bit frustrating, because it has already been clearly defined."
Very relevant feedback
"This initiative is an excellent way to quickly gather information about the EdTech strategy, and I would highly recommend it to everyone."
"The tone of response is too formal, again it doesn't have the ability to think outside the box. It only gives response in general terms"
fully satisfied
Looks good... especially with its response time
It's a good interactive platform. Provides basic summaries required which is good for some knowledge on the run.
The chatbot replies fast and it's very smooth
"The bot is good and easy to navigate through. Since it is easy to use, this will make students and others to use it on their own."
I think it will be good if there would be an option where one can upload a PDF document or a Word document too.
good enough

"Just typed ""yo"" and it became a talkative bombarding me with 250 words"
It's ok
It is simple and straightforward
Still trying to have an interaction with it
Very satisfied
"Some student and teachers are going to find it difficult using it , so I will presume if it can be made user friendly so that less privilege ict endowed user can use it."
I think the bot is simple and easy to navigate. It gives suggestions on questions to ask it and I think it's a good feature to incorporate in an AI Chatbot. It makes me understand in simple terms what the strategy is about and it is comprehensive to even the layman to grasp.
"The strategy bot is generally interactive and quick. This may depend on the internet connectivity anyway,"
Satisfied.
Easy to use.
Very smart and interactive.
Great experience

Highly satisfied.
The fact that AI has been taken care of at this stage of the strategy is key and appreciated.
I am highly satisfied with the chat bot and the content in the EdTech strategy.
The EdTech Chatbot is quite slow and often unresponsive. It takes a long time to process inputs and sometimes fails to reply entirely
No comment for now
I like the fact that there are preconceived questions which are on a lot of minds. This definitely is a great start if only the implementation stages would be seamlessly engaging.
It gives a misleading response. When I prompted for all 14 themes it list with other themes that are not part
it is engaging
i am satisfied
Elextremely interactive but a little challenging when working with my speech software
"So far good, but there should a navigation to access the full strategy at ago."
Normal
Bad
It's been nice having an interaction with the tool.

"yes, the 10 objectives make sense to me"
The response rate is apt
The populated guiding questions are productive
I'm still reviewing
The question what is Ghanas Edtech Strategy took a long time and didn't bring a response
"It does a good job explaining the key priorities in the education sector and how technology is being used to improve learning."
"It doesn’t show where the information comes from, so it’s hard to confirm if the answers are from official sources."
"It is a very simple, clean and engaging bot. The prompts make it very easy for first timers to fully engage and be locked in."
"The follow up questions are also great and spot on, giving users more insight into the topics."
"On areas of persons with disability, the responses or strategies appeared to be very generic with little in depth solutions or examples."
"For some reason I was unable to access the microphone option."
"The platform is very informative on topics or domains that are being provided."
"The platform does not also provide specific solution to certain education needs. An example is, I asked the chatbot to give me specific technologies put in place to help people in special education and the response was just about providing digital platform that will help them."
"The chatbot is helpful and easy to use. The flow is smooth, and it gives quick responses that make the interaction feel easy."
"Sometimes, it feels a bit limited in how it answers questions, so improving the depth of responses and personalization would make it even more useful."

"The chatbot feels more like reading a textbook than a conversational text. It gives answers but doesn’t really engage the user or make the discussion interactive or interesting."
"It doesn’t adapt its responses to help users understand better. It’s very restricted."
"The chatbot  is user-friendly, responsive, and provides valuable educational support."
"The addition of our local languages alongside English has made the platform more inclusive and accessible to a wider range of users across the country."
"In areas with limited internet connectivity, users may experience slow or interrupted responses."
"The interface could be more visually appealing and interactive to keep users engaged."
"Sometimes, it takes a bit longer to get a response."
"The platform is user friendly,simple to understand and navigate."
"Each key strategies are detailed depending on your input and the processed data are easily to understand."
"On the other hand the platform interface on mobile phone is not compelling to use ,the chatbox takes quite a space covering most of the processed data displayed."
"I think the  logo or icon on the platform should take you back home when it been clicked on."
"The prompts provided (What is the EdTech Strategy’s vision? Who are the key stakeholders?) make it easy for first-time users  to know where to start."
"The addition of local Ghanaian languages alongside English has made the platform more inclusive and accessible to a wider range of users across the country."
"Limited guidance for deeper or specialized questions ( users might not know how to ask about governance, cybersecurity, or implementation.)"
"The bot’s responses feel accurate but too brief and impersonal, missing the opportunity to educate users in an engaging, contextual, and empowering way."
